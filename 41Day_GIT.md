Now we are giving protection to main branch

![ad5499af-890a-4c56-b970-2e3799024537.png|945](https://images.amplenote.com/fc989876-2eb9-11ef-80c0-3e95ff25d0e5/ad5499af-890a-4c56-b970-2e3799024537.png) [^4]

\

Now if want to make any changes, then i need to create a new branch and push the updated code

![](https://images.amplenote.com/fc989876-2eb9-11ef-80c0-3e95ff25d0e5/80367acd-222c-4023-bb75-76a0e00eddf3.png) [^6]

\

New updates/changes to code

![18001ff2-7600-4430-8112-cfd19a3a930c.png|678](https://images.amplenote.com/fc989876-2eb9-11ef-80c0-3e95ff25d0e5/18001ff2-7600-4430-8112-cfd19a3a930c.png) [^7]

\

pushing code to new branch 'feature-1'

```
git add, ; git commit -m "first commit from main branch"; git push origin feature-1
```

![c8f95c2a-9eee-475b-83a6-c34ffdb74f21.png|967](https://images.amplenote.com/fc989876-2eb9-11ef-80c0-3e95ff25d0e5/c8f95c2a-9eee-475b-83a6-c34ffdb74f21.png) [^8]

\

\

Now once all changes are good now pushing to main branch (pull request)

![d25466ca-a41a-4276-9e1f-607b8683d094.png|991](https://images.amplenote.com/fc989876-2eb9-11ef-80c0-3e95ff25d0e5/d25466ca-a41a-4276-9e1f-607b8683d094.png) [^9]

\

Below are the differences

<mark>**Merge changes to master**</mark>

Now all the development done by programmer in feature-1 branch, Now he will raise a pull request to main branch(approval/review the code).

[^38]: 1. no extra commit
    2. commit ids will change, rewrites the history
    3. it will not preserve the history.
    I
    a. is this looking like a rebase is created and merged
    b. is this looking a linear development happened in main branch

[^39]: a developer can do 60 commits. ..
    abcd433 --> project-1 have user module
    60 commits --> squash into single commit
    dif788 --> He completed catalogue module
    dfg67364
    --> tart module

[^40]: When to Use Git Rebase vs. Git Merge
    If the feature branch you are getting changes from is shared with other developers, then you
    should use merge. Rebasing is not recommended because the rebasing process will create
    inconsistent repositories.
    You should also use merge if you want to see the history as it happened. Merge preserves
    history, whereas rebase rewrites it.
    Rebasing makes the most sense for an individual project. Rebasing is useful for streamlining a
    complex history. You are able to change the commit history via an interactive rebase. You can
    remove undesired commits, squash two or more commits into one or edit the commit message.

[^41]: fast-forward merge --> build once in DEV and run anywhere
    feature --> DEV, QA --> success
    main --> but same commit ID whatever tested in feature branch

[^42]: main
    feature --> apart from main anything called as feature branch
    main is long lived branch, feature is short lived branch
    developers create feature branches, once they complete development they will raise PR and
    merge/rebase into main branch
    feature branch, before raising PR. .. let's do CICD in DEV environment. if success in DEV then
    you can raise PR
    then rebase into main. ..
    code is same across all environments, but configuration is different
    configuration should be detached from code, we are using SSM parameter store

[^43]: we got into main branch
    --> QA, SIT, UAT, PRE-PROD, PERF, PROD
